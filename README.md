The GiNGR framework allows one to perform non-rigid registration with an iterative algorithm that makes use of Gaussian Process Regression in each iteration to find its next state. 

Existing algorithms can be converted into the GiNGR framework, and compared based on 3 properties:
 
 - Kernel function: how similar should the deformation of neighbouring points be - this is determined based on their correlation
 - Correspondence estimation function: how to estimate corresponding points between the moving instance (reference) and the target.
 - Observation uncertainty: what is the noise assumption of the correspondence estimations?

This framework contains a general library to input these 3 properties. 

The core part of the GiNGR framework is found in `gingr/api/GingrAlgorithm` with the `update` function performing one iteration of GiNGR update.
Different pre-implemented configuration files can be found in `gingr/api/registration/config` for CPD and ICP.

## Installation
To use the GiNGR framework, you can make use of the maven snapshot by including the follow in your Scala 3 script:

```
//> using repository "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots"
//> using lib "ch.unibas.cs.gravis::gingr:0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
```

If using SBT, then add the following to your `build.sbt`:

```
resolvers +=
  "Sonatype OSS Snapshots" at "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots"
libraryDependencies += "ch.unibas.cs.gravis" %% "gingr" % "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
```

Or you can install GiNGR to your local repo (_.ivy2_) by running `sbt publishLocal`.

To run the examples, we make use of the VSCODE IDE. For installation help, please see https://scalismo.org/docs/Setup/vscode.

After installing VSCODE:

 - Go to the examples folder: `cd examples`
 - Setup Code IDE with `scala-cli setup-ide .`
 - Open the IDE with `code .`
 - Now run the individual examples

## General use
To use GiNGR, one need to specify the deformation model to use in form of a GPMM model as well as the correspondence estimation function and the uncertainty update.
### Define the prior model
The creation of the GPMM is separate from the registration step. For examples, look in the `examples` folder where demo scripts have been created to compute and visualize GPMMs for an Armadillo, Bunny and a Femur bone. In the UI, the deformation model can be evaluated by sampling from it.
### Configure the registration algorithm
The next step is to define the correspondence and uncertainty estimation update. 
For this, default configurations have been implemented for CPD and ICP. 
Simple Demo applications can be found in `examples/DemoICP` and `examples/DemoCPD`

The demo scripts both perform deterministic and probabilistic registration one after the other. 

### GiNGR state
In each iteration a new GiNGR state is computed which contains the GPMM model, the current `fit`, the target as well as all the GPMM model parameters (non-rigid and global pose).

### Deterministic vs Probabilistic
The probabilistic implementation is based on the ICP-Proposal repository: https://github.com/unibas-gravis/icp-proposal
#### Visualizing the posterior output from probabilistic fitting
The posterior output from the ICP probabilistic registration of the femur bone can be visualized with `apps/registration/DemoPosteriorVisualizationFemur`.

### Inclusion of Landmarks
In `examples/DemoLandmarks` we compare 10 iterations of CPD for the Armadillo with and without the use of landmarks.

### Multi-resolution fitting
In `examples/DemoMultiResolution` we perform 3 different registrations of GiNGR one after the other. 
First CPD is used on a very coarse mesh (100 vertices), then CPD is used on a medium fine mesh (500 vertices) and finally, ICP is used on a finer mesh (1000 points) to get the fine details of the target mesh.


## Implementation of existing algorithms
In the GiNGR code base, the basic implementations of existing algorithms can also be found for comparison. The algorithms are found under `gingr/other/algorithms`
